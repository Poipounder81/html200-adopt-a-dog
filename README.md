# Adopt-a-dog Website 
*HTML200 Course Project - Ryan Mamuad*

## Description

The purpose of this site is to help the Adoptadog website reach potential adopters online, whether on a phone, tablet, or desktop device.

## User personas

Users for this website site are adults over the age of 18 in the Seattle area. Because the site is new, we don't have analytics history for the specific users of the site. We plan to collect end user data over time and test on different browsers and devices. For now, we tested for commonly used browsers and devices in the United States that would fit these user personas.

* User Jisoo is a busy 28 years old mom who is looking for a second family dog. She pursues dog adoption sites during her kids' soccer games on her Samsung phone.

* User Ros√© is a college student currently attending the University of Washington. When not studying or practing for her passion in music, she momentarily takes breaks to scan the web and research for available dog adoptions within the greater Seattle area on her laptop. 

* Users Jennie and Lisa are a newly married couple looking to get their first dog together. Jennie is an up and coming singer/songwriter. Lisa teaches hiphop classes at a local dance studio. They both prefer to research for dogs on their desktop PC so they can browse together. Because they are going to be new dog owners, they are taking their time to do their research and will access the Adoptadog blog for tips on dog ownership.

* User Alice is a older single person who works as a project manager at YG Entertainment. Although she is blind, she preferes to research for dogs on her laptop using a screen reader. She will use any available assistive techonology and the skip link to dive into the content. She finds the detailed alt descriptions of the dog photos to be valuable in her search.
